    <string name="managementTheSoulenikoesInformationBiographyBlurb1">Fuelled by homegrown influences COG, Jericco, Karnivool, Dead Letter Circus and MM9, The Soulenikoes have finished 
        recording \'Reborn\', a 4-track ep aimed to push them onto the Australian alternate music scene. With an impressive live show and one iron-clad bond, The Soulenikoes are 
        determined to show how they do it in the west.</string>

    <string name="managementTomMilekInformationHeading">Tom Milek Information</string>
    <string name="managementTomMilekInformationBiographyBlurb1">Tom Milek is a singer-songwriter based in Melbourne. His music has drawn comparisons to Damien Rice, Ryan Adams 
        and Whitley. His debut EP is available on iTunes.</string>
    <string name="managementTomMilekInformationReleasesBlurb2">Love and Ambition EP (2012)</string>
    <string name="managementTomMilekInformationDescriptionBlurb3">What others have said: \"Tom Milek writes songs that epitomise the coming of age period and those familiar feelings of being young 
        and in love/lust and living in the moment. No, these themes are not new, but Milek\'s vivid lyrics and slightly rough vocal delivery exude an honesty and vulnerability that makes his 
        songs relatable.\" -Inpress \"Leaving a lot of his material very much up to interpretation, without forcing any sort of view or opinion down your throat; he really lets you make up your 
        mind about everything he portrays in his music.\" -Wax Waves \"I love [Vicious Curves] organic feel, which sounds like the best of Ryan Adams with a bit of Whitley thrown in.\" -Sounds of Oz 
        \"Milek draws the attention of the room every time he steps in front of a microphone; whether he’s playing to a dozen people sitting on beer infested floor, or a packed band room. A strong 
        but vulnerable voice so addictive you wish he\’d sing his stage banter.\" -Young Folks Music \"Melbourne musician Tom Milek plays some really really gorgeous music, he\’s just released his 
        debut EP \‘Love And Ambition\’, and the title sums up Tom\’s music quite well: it would be a bit cliched if it wasn\'t so genuine and so deftly executed. The themes of Tom\’s music may not 
        be new, but he deals with issues of love and maturity with a vividness and starkness that is very, very Damien Rice-esque.\" -And Pluck Your Strings</string>

    <string name="managementTheUniversalInformationHeading">The Universal Information</string>
    <string name="managementTheUniversalInformationBiographyBlurb1">\"Featuring jangly, angular guitars, driving beats and an energetic lead vocalist who sounds like he\’s had too many 
        coffees on the morning of recording and has developed a stutter as a result\" - Tone Deaf</string>

    <string name="servicesPublicity">Publicity</string>
    <string name="servicesPublicityBlurb1">Do you want your newly recorded music to get out there, hitting all forms of media accross the country? And do you want to tour your music around Australia and play it out in

    <string name="servicesTraining">Training</string>
    <string name="servicesTrainingBlurb1">One of our mantras at Spinning Half is to always allow someone who\'s interested in learning about our field the opportunity to do so. If that means taking on board work experience
        students, providing on site mentoring or running dedicated classes then that\'s what it will be. Understanding that there are many areas involved in running a successful event and that they 
        all have to operate together is key. Education in each component and where it is in the event timeline (pre, during or post event) is available and comes from a practical, tried &amp; tested
        music industry angle. </string>
    <string name="servicesTrainingBlurb2">We offer areas in education such as Booking Bands &amp; Management, Promotions &amp; PR and Technical Operation. There is the music side and there is the business side to 
        the Music Indusrty and we can assure you that, if you\'re interested, there exists a field for you which is both rewarding and fun.</string>
    <string name="servicesTrainingBlurb3">The Spinning Half team is available to come to schools, organizations and meetups to educate and encourage students &amp; attendees about what possibilities there
        are when considering a life in the Music Industry. </string>
    <string name="servicesDistribution">Distribution</string>
    <string name="servicesDistributionBlurb1">If you have some advertising content that you need to get distributed direct to the public then use us! We have dedicated street teams available for poster 
        distribution campaigns and have extensive knowledge of key local areas where the content is most effective &amp; can get you the most band for your buck! </string>
    <string name="servicesDistributionBlurb2">Some of our past jobs have been: i) The Australian Government\'s \'Get Reading!\' initiative which ran nationwide in 2012. Our responsibility was to deliver
        handbooks to all Geelong and The Surfcoast Region primary schools thereby encouraging the development of parent-child reading activities. It was a rewarding job for all of us. ii) Music Industry National
        &amp; International Tours have been a consistent area of expertise for us. Past tours we\'ve worked on have been D12 (International), Xzibit(Internation), Boy &amp; Bear (National), Parkway Drive (National)
